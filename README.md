## 📖 How It Works

1. **Initiation:** Type `Claim NFT` to the bot.
2. **NFT Generation:** The bot kickstarts a procedure, summoning a pre-minted NFT via Pintata (IPFS), Infura, Lexica Art AI, and XRPL POAP API.
3. **Hosting:** Our Firebase application becomes the proud home for the new NFT.
4. **QR Code Generation:** A QR code, acting as a bridge to the NFT, is swiftly generated and shared.
5. **Claiming:** Users scan the QR code, leading them to our Firebase haven, where the NFT awaits its new owner.
